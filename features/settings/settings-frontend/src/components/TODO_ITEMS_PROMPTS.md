 TODO 3:
 Now we should give capability to users of creating thier own columns or labels or categories 
 For example:
  As. tenant admin, i can give permission to my supervisor that he can create customs Columns, Labels etc... through a page called Roles & Permissions.
  Now Tenant admin or supervisor or whatever roles he have created can go ahead and create the labels & Categories etc...

  For example in: http://localhost:8081/downtime
   When user clicks on "Report Downtime" if a tenant doesn't found the provided categories are not relevant for his/her organization then he can add or delete 
   Under : Report Downtime
   We have categories & by default we are showing categories as Breakdown, Maintenance, Changeover, Material, Power, Quality, Other, user should be able to add, edit or delete these categories
   And this changes should be apllied to only that tenant.
